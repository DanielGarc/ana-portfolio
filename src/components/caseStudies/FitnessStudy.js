            Fitness instructors have a lot to work on, not just classes but,
            working with people, with their goals, not only changing their body
            but their minds.

            Fitness instructors have a lot to work on, not just classes but,
            working with people, with their goals, not only changing their body
            but their minds. This is hard to do when you have to write
            everything on paper or don’t have enough time to work with them
            personally, or remind them all about their classes or their goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trainers are looking for something that it can be with them all the
            time, always up to date with what’s going on with their clients, and
            removing that layer of awkwardness to go and ask for the payments.

            Challenge
            <br />
            How can we build an engaging app that lets trainers and trainees
            manage their workouts and payments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Solution
            <br />
            An app that will be up to date with what’s going on with their
            clients and send reminders to trainees about payments.

          When I accepted this project <b>I thought I knew </b> what the
          application would look like at the end, or what the product was and
          its needs because I’m a fitness instructor, <b> I was wrong </b>. How
          did I gather information? Great question! I did the following
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I analize what types of question and what audience I’ll be

          </li>
          <li>
            Interview with coaches, fitness instructor and people who exercise
            regularly and not regularly.

          <p>
            After analyzing the data gathered from surveys, interviews,
            shadowings, I started building the personas and creating the user
            journey map.
          </p>
          <p>
            By doing the previous I got a more define idea of the main targets,
            it also helped me to always keep in mind the user’s needs and goals.
            Whenever I got stuck in the user flow I always went back and re-read
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the creationf of the user flow the main differences between
            trainer and trainees was their authority.

      <div className='workshop'>
        <img alt='' src={workshop} />
        <h2> Workshop</h2>
        <h3>
          {' '}
          <i> Who doesn’t love good ideas? </i>{' '}
        </h3>

        <p>
          One of the things I like to do the most is generating ideas with a
          team, for this workshop, I asked a couple of colleagues to help me
          with some exercises because I wanted to know how they would tackle the
          problems in their own way. I explained the purpose of this app, the
          challenge and lay down the problems found in our target audience. I
          wrote down the problems on top of the board so everyone could have a
          vision of the problems and started generating ideas, after a couple of
          minutes we stop and did dot voting.
        </p>
        <p>
          While creating all these ideas my colleagues kept asking questions
          that I didn’t think of or didn’t question the “why” of some of the
          problems. <b>We went back to Discovery and Define </b> to review them
          again, we compare them with the workshop ideas and modified the user
          flow.
        </p>
